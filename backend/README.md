# Backend

The backend is based on the [Slim Framework](https://www.slimframework.com)
with the [PHP-DI container](http://php-di.org/).

## Install

See also [doc/Install.md](../doc/Install.md#server-requirements) for prerequisites.

dev:
```
composer install
composer compile
```

prod:
```
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader --no-interaction
composer compile:prod
```

The differences between `dev` and `prod` mode (which is determined by the environment variable 
`NEUCORE_APP_ENV`) are:
- Doctrine proxy classes are auto-generated in dev mode, the APCu cache is used in prod mode
- PHP-DI uses compilation and the APCu cache in prod mode

## Style Guide

This project uses the [PER Coding Style 2.0](https://www.php-fig.org/per/coding-style/).

You can partially check and fix the code by executing the following:
```
composer style:check
composer style:fix
```

## Guidelines

### Clear Entity Manager

Sometimes it's necessary to clear the Doctrine entity manager. But never do this outside Command or
Controller classes.

### Tests

Unit tests should cover any new code.

### Libraries and Plugins

If you update libraries that are also included in the 
[tkhamez/neucore-plugin](https://github.com/tkhamez/neucore-plugin), update them there as well and create a 
new release together with the Neucore release.

## API

### operationId

The `operationId` must be a unique string among all operations described in the API.

### Documentation

The file [doc/API.md](../doc/API.md) is automatically generated from the template file `doc/API.tpl.md`, 
the route and security configuration from the `config` directory and `web/openapi-3.yaml`:
```
bin/doc-api-gen.php
```

### ESI routes

The `/api/app/v2/esi` endpoint uses a denylist to block requests to publicly accessible ESI routes. 
This list is stored in `config/esi-paths-public.php` and can be regenerated with:

```
bin/esi-paths-public.php
```

## Console Commands

### Console application

Run the console app to see all available commands:

```
bin/console
```

To debug, start like this:
```sh
php -dxdebug.start_with_request=yes bin/console
```

### Commands via Composer

Run unit tests, with or without HTML coverage:
```
composer test:cov
composer test
```

Execute database migrations:
```
composer db:migrate
```

Load data fixtures:
```
composer db:seed
```

Generate OpenAPI interface description files:
```
composer openapi
```

Check code with PHPStan, Phan and Psalm:
```
composer phpstan
composer phan
composer psalm
```

### Doctrine

Generate proxy classes:
```
bin/doctrine orm:generate-proxies
```

Generate constructor, getters and setters (deprecated):
```
bin/doctrine orm:generate-entities src
```

Validate the mapping files:
```
bin/doctrine orm:validate-schema -v
```

Generate a migration by comparing the current database to the mapping information.  
Set the server version to generate compatible syntax, e.g.
`mysql://neucore:password@127.0.0.1/core?serverVersion=10.5.22-MariaDB-1:10.5.22+maria~ubu2004`:
```
vendor/bin/doctrine-migrations migrations:diff
```

Execute a single migration, e.g.:
```
vendor/bin/doctrine-migrations migrations:execute Neucore\\Migrations\\Version20240601205616 --up
vendor/bin/doctrine-migrations migrations:execute Neucore\\Migrations\\Version20240601205616 --down
```
