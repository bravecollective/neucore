# API

Roles protect all API endpoints from the backend.

The API is documented with OpenAPI. It is available with every installation at `/api.html`.

Please note that schema properties that are not required and are of the type of another schema can
also be null. Unfortunately, this cannot be documented in this way. For example, `Character.corporation`
can be a `Corporation` object, be null or not exist at all.
