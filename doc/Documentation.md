## Features

Main features:

* **EVE SSO** login with configurable permission scopes.
* **Player accounts** with multiple characters.
* **Groups** and **apps** with managers.
* **Automatic group assignment** for players based on corporations and alliances from all of their characters.
* An **API for applications** to query group membership of characters, ESI data and more.
* General purpose [plugins](Plugins.md) with their own frontend and 
  plugins for **service registration** (e.g. Discord, Mumble).

  optionally available for apps, compatible with the ESI OpenAPI definition file. See also 
  [api-examples](api-examples).
* Configurable rate limits for apps or IP-based for all requests to the backend.
* CLI commands for data updates from ESI.
* Usable on small touch screens.

## Installation and Configuration

See [Install.md](Install.md).

Read `backend/.env.dist` for some optional configuration that is not (yet) described here.

## Application API

All API functions are documented with [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) and can be found at
https://your.domain/api.html. Most of these endpoints are for the frontend,
only the routes listed in the `Application` groups are for Neucore applications. For these there is also a
separate OpenAPI definition file at https://your.domain/application-api-3.yml.

### Authentication

First an application must be created by an app administrator and assigned to an app manager, 
who can then generate the app secret.

Apps are authenticated using an HTTP authorization header.

The authorization string is composed of the word Bearer followed by a base64-encoded
string containing the app ID and secret separated by a colon (1:my awesome secret).

Example:
```
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer MTpteSBhd2Vzb21lIHNlY3JldA==" https://neucore.tld/api/app/v1/show
```

### Rate Limits

If the *API rate limit for apps* is enabled (UI: Admin -> Settings -> Features), each response will contain 
the headers `X-Neucore-Rate-Limit-Remain` and `X-Neucore-Rate-Limit-Reset`. A request results in an error 
429 "Too many requests" if the limit has been exceeded.

If it is configured only, but not active, it is logged when an app exceeds the limit.

If the *IP-based rate limit* is also active (environment variable), the headers contain the values of the rate limit 
with the lower "remain" value.

Note that IP-based rate limit works without a database connection and needs the APCu PHP extension.

### ESI Proxy

The endpoint `/app/v2/esi` acts as an ESI proxy for each character token that was added.

There's a command `bin/console check-tokens` that can be used as a cronjob to keep the refresh token valid. It 
also implements refresh token rotation.

The API respects the ESI cache headers and will return a cached response if it is still valid.

### Access Token

As an alternative to the ESI proxy, applications can also request an ESI token from 
`/app/v1/esi/access-token/{characterId}`.

#### ESI Error Limit

The ESI error limit of 100 errors every 60 seconds is reduced to 80 errors every 60 seconds. It is  
shared between all applications that use the ESI API endpoint. The `X-Esi-Error-Limit-Remain` header is
*not* modified to reflect this. The API will return a 429 status code if it gets below 21, including 
a `Retry-After` header.

## Service Registration Plugins

See [Plugins](Plugins.md).

## Player Accounts

### Character Registration

Each EVE character belongs to a player account, an account can have several characters.

When a character logs in via EVE SSO for the first time, a new player account is created
and that character is marked as the main character.

After a successful login, additional characters (alts) can be added to the account. This
is also done via EVE SSO.

If a character to be added to an account already belongs to another account, the two accounts will 
be merged by moving all characters from the newer account to the older one, unless the character owner
hash of the character being added has changed, which happens after a character transfer.

### Removing Characters

When it was detected that an EVE character was deleted or was transferred to another EVE account, 
it will be removed from its current player account.

An admin can also manually delete a character, a player can do this if that is enabled in the system setting.

All character removals are recorded and are visible to user admins.

### Account status

There a two account status: "standard" and "manually managed".

- The status can be changed at any time by a user admin.
- If the status is changed, all groups are removed. New groups can be added manually in the same way as for normal 
  accounts.
- Automatic group assignment is disabled for manually managed accounts, "Required Groups" are still checked, see below.
- Groups are never deactivated for manually managed accounts.

## Multiple EVE Logins

Any number of EVE logins with different ESI scopes can be configured. Players can add ESI tokens to their 
characters for each of these logins.

EVE logins can be added to apps so that they can use their tokens. This also applied to the token of 
the default login (core.default).

There is also a separate build in login URL that does not require any ESI scopes (must be allowed in settings).

## Groups

Visibility
- public: everyone can see them and apply to them.
- private: hidden from non-members

A group can be configured to be added to every account. This still obeys the configurable requirements to
be in that group.

### Automatic Group Assignment

Alliances and corporations can be assigned to groups. These groups are then managed automatically. 
This means that every player who has a character in one of these alliances or corporations will 
automatically become a member of these groups.

Once a group has been removed from all alliances and corporations, it will no longer be managed 
automatically. This also means that all players who are currently members of this group will 
remain so. To correct this, this group can simply be deleted, or it must be assigned a manager 
who can then manually remove all members.

### Group Deactivation

If the ESI token of one or more characters on an account is invalid, the account can be disabled. This is done 
on the settings page, feature "Groups Deactivation". A character without a token (no ESI scopes were requested 
during login) counts as invalid.

Deactivation means that the API for apps no longer returns groups for that account. The deactivation of the 
account can be delayed, e.g. by 24 hours after a token became invalid.

As soon as the token was updated by logging in with the appropriate character, the account will be reactivated.

### Prerequisite for roles

Roles can be limited to players with certain groups. If configured, roles will be removed when a player looses
the group(s). This does _not_ take the "Groups Deactivation" feature into account.

### Required and Forbidden Groups

Other groups can be added to a group as a prerequisite. This means that players must be members of at least one of 
these other groups, otherwise they will be automatically removed from the group.

It is also possible to configure groups that an account cannot be a member of to be a member of that group.

Those check is also done for "manually managed" Player accounts (see "Account status" above).

### Group Applications

Groups can be configured to be available for members to apply to. Managers can then accept or deny those applications,
it's also possible to automatically accept applications.

## Member Tracking

Access to corporation member tracking data is configured by adding groups to a corporation whose 
members are allowed to see the data of that corporation.

The "tracking" role is automatically added to or removed from the player when this configuration is changed or 
members are added or removed from these groups.

## Watchlist

The permissions are managed via groups, one for viewing and one for administration, separately for each watch list.

Corporations can be automatically added to the allowlist (and removed accordingly) if all their members 
are on the same account using the `auto-allowlist` command. This only works if at least one character in
that corporation has authorized the `esi-corporations.read_corporation_membership.v1` ESI scope. Note that 
the auto flag of a corporation is the same for all watchlists. This means that automatic additions and 
removals have priority over manually adding and removing a corporation from the allow list.

## Mail Notifications

Note: The ESI refresh token used to send the mails is not automatically refreshed when no mails are sent. This is 
relevant should CCP add refresh token rotation for web-based applications. See also 
[esi-docs - SSO Response](https://docs.esi.evetech.net/docs/sso/refreshing_access_tokens.html#sso-response)
(from the old docs, this part is not in the [new docs](https://developers.eveonline.com/docs/services/sso/)).

### Invalid ESI Token

An EVE mail can be sent for accounts with characters with an invalid ESI token.

This mail will only be sent once and only if one of the characters in the account is a member of an alliance 
that was previously configured. It will be sent to the main character, if any, or to one of the characters that 
have an invalid token.

### Missing Character

An EVE mail can be sent to characters that were not added to an account.

This mail will only be sent to members of configured corporations where member tracking must be enabled. It will 
only be sent if the character has logged in within a configurable number of days and will be sent again after the 
same number of days.

## Console Application

The console application has commands to:
- update characters with information from ESI, like corporation etc.
- check ESI tokens of all characters.
- perform automatic group assignments.
- update member tracking data.
- update auto allowlist of watchlists.
- update service accounts.
- send EVE mail to accounts with deactivated groups.
- delete expired HTTP cache entries.

See `backend/bin/run-jobs.sh` for a script that runs them all in a sensible order.

## Data Structure (Backend)

(partial representation)
 
![Entity–relationship model](er-model.png)

- `players` identifies EVE players. Each player account can have one or more `characters`. One
  character is marked as the "Main" character, the rest are "Alts".
- `apps` are applications that have access to the "Application API". They can have several groups.
- A player account can be member of several `groups`.
- A player account can be manager of several groups and apps.
- `corporations` and `alliances` can have several groups for automatic group assignments.
- `roles` define what a player or app can do.
