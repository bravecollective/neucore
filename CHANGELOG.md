To update a service plugin configuration:

- Open its service admin page twice in two different browser tabs.
- Choose the appropriate plugin from the dropdown list at the top. *Attention*: this will load the default 
  configuration values from the plugin.yml file!
- Copy any configuration values from the "Optional" block from the second tab that you want to keep (probably all).
